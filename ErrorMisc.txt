Error on test 2581

Each xmlconf.xml refers to tests within its subdirectory tree.

In the root xmlconf directory xmlconf.xml, there is an inconsistancy,
such that the path referred to in 

<!ENTITY eduni-misc         SYSTEM "eduni/misc/ht-bh.xml">
does not correspond to 
<TESTCASES xml:base="eduni/namespaces/misc/">
    &eduni-misc;
</TESTCASES>

and should be <TESTCASES xml:base="eduni/misc/">

as the misc in the archive is a subdirectory eduni

The error is repeated in xmlconf/eduni/xmlconf.xml,
where <TESTCASES xml:base="namespaces/misc/">

should be <TESTCASES xml:base="misc/">
